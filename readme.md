# Overview
I'm just following along with 'Hello Backbone.js' at http://arturadib.com/hello-backbonejs/

This is just a for fun, following along repo to learn more about Backbone.js so
I can start integrating it into more projects to have cleaner, leaner, meaner code.

# Notes
Make sure to use underscore v1.3.1+, especially if you notice you are getting
undefined function errors.

Because of this change prior to v1.3.1:  

"Reverted an old change so that _.extend will correctly copy over keys with
undefined values again."
